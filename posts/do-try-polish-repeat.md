The secret ingredient behind nice-looking UIs?

It’s not talent nor a “good eye”; the ingredient is called **do-try-polish-repeat**…

The more experience you have, the fewer grams of do-try-polish-repeat you need.

If something doesn’t feel right to you, it means it needs another do-try-polish-repeat cycle.

Still feels wrong, and you’re out of ideas? Don’t worry, go grab a coffee, show it to someone else… increase your inputs, move your brain to something else… It will click, slowly but surely.

I can share a personal example of this approach for the homepage of [100cims](https://100cims.app).

#### First iteration, borders and too many colors

At this stage, I had a solid idea of what information I wanted to highlight on the homepage, but the overall design vibe was still not there.

- **The links**, I wanted to make them really visible, but the blue color was too much.
- **The latest summits section**, the _boxed_ approach wasn't feeling right, borders do incur noise and the scoring number had too much weight on the page.

I was not sure how to proceed, so I continued building other pages waiting for inspiration.

#### Second iteration, cleanup

In this second iteration, I went for the areas that felt the worst:

- **The links** are now greyed out, with an arrow indicating that they are navigation buttons.
- **The latest summits section**, while still boxed, I got rid of the meaningless scoring punctuation.

Other very minor changes happened on **Peaks for you** section, that changed their name from **Next peaks**, and also the
`essential` tag was inlined with the height attribute.

While the interface was getting cleaner, it didn't yet feel perfect, one more iteration cycle was needed.

#### Third and current iteration

Days have passed since the previous iteration; I continued working on other parts of the app, when I came back to it, everything finally clicked:

- **The score section**, now has a bigger but shorter gray link, in the content, we can find a counter of the essentials peaks done, indicated by a circular sphere. 
- **Latest summits**, got the borders and people names removed, de-clutering the section. 
- **Recommended**, shortened the texts, reduced the image weight, and linked visually the top section with the essential tag by using the pink sphere.

On top of that, I added a dark/light button on the top bar, and while I know a _click-once-and-forget_ button like that shouldn't be on this position
is a nice filler for this app version.

### Finale

Both the first and second version were already _shippable_ but they had something _off_, the last version while by no means final (does that concept even exist on software?)
 doesn't feel _off_ anymore.
